- Think that LGBTQ+ people "shouldn't put it out on display"
- Support "drop the T", TERF, or similar movements.
- Think that pedophilia is included in LGBTQ+, either because you want it to be included, or you think

### What does this mean for me?

I get it, you don't have time to read the license. Here's some bullet points on what this license means for you.

- You may combine this library with other work that is under a different license, so long as the files of this library
  remain separate.
  - The code of this library, under the MPL-2.0 license (or compatible), must be made readily available to users.
  - Recipients of the larger work must be made aware of the use of this library, its license, and how to acquire the code
    of this library.
- Any modifications of this library's files must be published under the MPL-2.0.
- You may use this library commercially, so long as it is made clear that it is done on your own behalf, and not on the behalf
  of the contributors.

There is some more nuance than that, but those bullet points cover the general points.

### Contribution

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the work by you shall
be licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.

All commits must be signed-off (`git commit -s`). This is a declaration that you have read and agree to the terms in the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO). This can be compared to a CLA, but is different in that
your copyright remains with you. All you are doing is attesting that you can contribute code under the repository's license.
A copy of the DCO text is kept in this repository at DCO.txt.

You may sign the DCO with your preferred name, so long as it is relatively consistent, so we can keep track of who's who.
